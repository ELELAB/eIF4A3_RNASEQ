here we perform the correlation analysis between expression profiles of eIF4A3
and different sets of genes, considering TCGA samples belonging to different tumour 
subtypes. We do this either by just considering all subtypes or only those in which
eIF4A3 is deregulated as shown by differential expression analysis.
