here we perform expression correlation analysis using Primary tumour samples
between the expression profiles of eIF4A3 and two sets of genes: one which is
those controlled by TFEB and one which is those identified by enrichment
analysis. The corr_genes_TPonly.R script performs the analysis; the other
scripts perform different types of plotting, analysis and clustering.
