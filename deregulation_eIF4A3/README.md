This directory contains summarizing and plotting of the log of fold change
values from DEA for different cancer types and subtypes, in the respective
scripts. Notice that cancer type CHOL is found in the type comparison but isn't
in the subtype comparison because it lacks of subtype definition. Also, some
subtypes which were not included in the DEA to begin with are also not found
here.
